    <h1>Right to Equality</h1>
    <p>Ensures equal treatment before the law, prohibiting discrimination.</p>

    <p>The Right to Equality is one of the most essential pillars of the Indian Constitution. Enshrined in Articles 14 to 18, this fundamental right guarantees equal protection of the law and prohibits discrimination on various grounds. It forms the basis of a just and fair society where every individual—regardless of caste, religion, gender, or social status—is treated equally under the law.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Article 15 – Prohibition of Discrimination</h3>

      <li>Prohibits the State from discriminating on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</li>
      <li>Allows the State to make special provisions for women, children, SCs, STs, and socially and educationally backward classes.</li>

    <h3>Article 16 – Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Guarantees equal opportunity for all citizens in matters related to public employment or appointment to any office under the State.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 17 – Abolition of Untouchability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Declares untouchability as a punishable offense.</li>
      <li>Forbids its practice in any form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 18 – Abolition of Titles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prohibits the State from conferring any titles (except military or academic distinctions).</li>
      <li>Prevents citizens of India from accepting titles from foreign States.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of the Right to Equality:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Promotes social justice and dignity.</li>
      <li>Forms the foundation of affirmative action and reservations in India.</li>
      <li>Acts as a shield against arbitrary actions by the government.</li>
      <li>Upholds the principle of secularism and inclusivity.</li>

    <p>This right is enforceable in courts, and citizens can approach the Supreme Court or High Courts in case of any violation.</p>
