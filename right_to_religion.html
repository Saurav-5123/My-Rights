    <h1>Right to Freedom of Religion</h1>
    <p>Allows freedom of religion and religious practices.</p>

    <p>The Right to Freedom of Religion is a fundamental right granted to every citizen of India, regardless of their faith. Enshrined in Articles 25 to 28 of the Indian Constitution, this right ensures that India remains a secular state, where individuals are free to practice, profess, and propagate any religion of their choice—or none at all.</p>

    <p>This right promotes religious harmony, safeguards individual conscience, and prevents state interference in matters of personal faith, within the bounds of public order and morality.</p>

    <h2>Key Provisions under the Right to Freedom of Religion:</h2>

    <h3>Article 25 – Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice, and Propagation of Religion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Every person has the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate their religion.</li>
      <li>Includes the right to observe religious rituals, wear religious attire, and preach one’s faith.</li>
      <li>Subject to reasonable restrictions related to public order, morality, and health.</li>
      <li>The State can regulate or restrict economic, financial, or political activities associated with religious practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 26 – Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes.</li>
      <li>Manage their own affairs in matters of religion.</li>
      <li>Own and acquire property.</li>
      <li>Administer such property according to law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 27 – Freedom from Taxation for Promotion of a Religion</h3>
    <p>No person shall be forced to pay any taxes if the proceeds are specifically used for promoting or maintaining any particular religion or religious denomination.</p>

    <h3>Article 28 – Freedom as to Attendance at Religious Instruction</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No religious instruction shall be provided in educational institutions wholly maintained by State funds.</li>
      <li>Religious instruction is allowed in institutions administered by the State but established under endowments or trusts requiring such instruction.</li>
      <li>Attendance in religious classes in such institutions is voluntary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scope and Limitations</h2>
    <p>While the Right to Religion is broad, it is not absolute. The State may intervene in the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To ensure public safety, order, morality, or health.</li>
      <li>To bring social reform, such as banning untouchability or sati.</li>
      <li>To regulate religious conversions if done through force, fraud, or inducement.</li>
      <li>To apply secular laws in civil matters (e.g., marriage, divorce, adoption).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of the Right to Religion:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Upholds secularism by maintaining state neutrality in religious matters.</li>
      <li>Protects minority faiths and ensures equality among all religious groups.</li>
      <li>Encourages interfaith harmony and peaceful coexistence.</li>
      <li>Prevents religious persecution and state favoritism.</li>
    </ul>
