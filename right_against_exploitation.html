    <h1>Right Against Exploitation</h1>
    <p>Prohibits forced labor and child exploitation.</p>

    <p>The Right Against Exploitation is a Fundamental Right enshrined in Articles 23 and 24 of the Indian Constitution. It seeks to protect individuals, especially the vulnerable sections of society, from human trafficking, forced labor, and child labor. This right upholds the dignity of labor and ensures that no person is subjected to exploitation under any circumstance.</p>

    <p>It is particularly important in a country like India, where economic and social disparities often make certain groups more susceptible to exploitation.</p>

    <h2>Article 23 – Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour</h2>
    <p><strong>Text:</strong><br/>“Traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.”</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prohibits human trafficking, including for sexual exploitation, slavery, or organ trade</li>
      <li>Bans begar (forced, unpaid labor), a practice often imposed on marginalized communities</li>
      <li>Covers bonded labor, where individuals are forced to work to repay debts</li>
      <li>Allows the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, but without discrimination</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 24 – Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories, etc.</h2>
    <p><strong>Text:</strong><br/>“No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.”</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prohibits the employment of children under 14 in hazardous industries</li>
      <li>Aims to protect children's health, safety, and development</li>
      <li>Further strengthened by child labor laws and judicial interventions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supporting Laws and Initiatives:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986</li>
      <li>The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976</li>
      <li>The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956</li>
      <li>National Child Labour Project (NCLP)</li>
      <li>Right to Education (Article 21A) indirectly supports this right</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of the Right Against Exploitation:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Protects human dignity and individual freedom</li>
      <li>Ensures safe and fair working conditions</li>
      <li>Prevents abuse of power, especially against the poor and uneducated</li>
      <li>Promotes social justice and equality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Challenges:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unreported cases of child labor and bonded labor in informal sectors</li>
      <li>Lack of awareness among laborers about their rights</li>
      <li>Enforcement gaps in rural and remote areas</li>
      <li>Poverty and lack of education continue to fuel exploitative practices</li>
    </ul>
